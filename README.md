# Web Performance and Accessibility Challenge
Solved by Ines

This repository contains solutions to the [web performance and accessibility challenge](https://github.com/Netcentric/web-performance-challenge).
Most solutions are done (and commited) gradually, taking into consideration that a lot of time there are some restrictions from business side developers can't affect and fact that different solutions are best options for different problems.

Note: all solution are in 'main' branch in which I merged 'semantic' as a first step of the challenge.
